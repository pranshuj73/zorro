### ZORRO — INTERNAL WEBSITE BUILD INSTRUCTION

You are building the **public-facing website for Zorro**.

This site is not informational. It is **positional**.
Its job is not to explain. Its job is to **assert dominance, speed, and inevitability**.

You are expected to think, research, and make judgment calls. You are not expected to blindly execute aesthetics.

---

## CORE INTENT

Zorro is an **MVP builder and product consultancy** for founders and product-driven teams.

The website must:

* Create **FOMO**
* Imply that most teams are slower, noisier, and less capable
* Signal that Zorro ships faster because of systems, taste, and leverage
* Make competent builders feel relief delegating execution
* Make everyone else feel unqualified to DIY

This is not a friendly brand.
This is not an explanatory brand.
This is not a volume business.

---

## HARD CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Visual

* Dark mode only
* No theme toggle
* High contrast, restrained palette
* Feels premium, intentional, slightly intimidating
* Zero “startup template” energy

### Structure

* Few sections
* Minimal copy
* No long scroll essays
* No verbose feature breakdowns
* No “Services / About / Pricing” boilerplate layouts

### Explicit exclusions

* No mention of any internal tools or boilerplates
* No mention of future products
* No product marketing language
* The site sells **capability and outcomes only**

---

## YOUR FIRST STEP (MANDATORY THINKING WORK)

Before design or code, you must internally resolve the following and let it guide every decision:

### 1. Brand interpretation (you define this)

You must decide and internalize:

* What Zorro *feels like*
* What it should repel
* What it should attract

Produce an internal brand model:

* 5–7 adjectives that describe Zorro
* 5–7 anti-adjectives (what it must never feel like)
* A single paragraph describing Zorro in plain language

This will later be documented in the markdown file.

---

### 2. Reference calibration (do not copy)

You are expected to study award-winning studio / consultancy websites and identify:

* How they guide attention
* How they use negative space
* How they imply confidence without verbosity
* How motion is used sparingly and deliberately

You are not copying layouts.
You are extracting **principles**.

---

## POSITIONING LOGIC (INVISIBLE BUT FELT)

Zorro exists because:

* Speed is the primary competitive advantage early-stage teams waste
* Most MVPs fail due to indecision, overengineering, or slow execution
* Teams underestimate the cost of “figuring it out themselves”

Zorro’s edge is implied as:

* Systemized execution
* Taste-driven decision-making
* Aggressive reduction of ambiguity
* Modern tooling (including AI) used pragmatically to move faster and cheaper

You **do not** explain process step-by-step.
You **do not** evangelize AI.
You **do** imply leverage.

---

## COPY GUIDELINES (YOU WRITE ALL COPY)

Tone:

* Declarative
* Minimal
* Confident
* Unapologetic

Rules:

* Short sentences
* No buzzword stacking
* No marketing fluff
* No teaching tone
* Assume reader is technically literate

The copy should subtly communicate:

* “Most teams move slowly.”
* “Speed is structural, not effort-based.”
* “If you need convincing, you’re not the client.”

Avoid:

* Explanations
* Jargon for its own sake
* Emotional warmth
* Startup optimism clichés

---

## INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE (LOOSE, NOT FORMULAIC)

Expect **3–5 sections max**.

Possible shape (adapt if needed):

### 1. Hero

* Strong, compact statement
* Immediately establishes authority and intent
* Visual anchor that sets tone

### 2. Reframing the problem

* Why shipping is harder than people admit
* Why most teams stall
* No blame, just inevitability

### 3. Zorro’s advantage

* Speed
* Systems
* Reduced decision surface
* Modern execution
* Keep it abstract but sharp

### 4. Call to action

* Minimal
* Confident
* Possibly intentionally frictional
* No desperate conversion tactics

No cluttered footer.
No navigation overload.

---

## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

### Layout

* Avoid rigid top-to-bottom linear flow
* Allow elements to:

  * float
  * overlap
  * interrupt expected hierarchy
* The page should feel **composed**, not stacked

### Motion

Motion is a signal, not decoration:

* Subtle parallax
* Scroll-linked reveals
* Micro-interactions
* Delays that reward attention

No:

* Heavy animations
* Gimmicks
* Performance regression

### Easter eggs

* Small, non-obvious interactions
* Rewards for observant users
* Nothing playful or loud

The site should feel **quietly dangerous**, not flashy.

---

## TECHNICAL EXPECTATIONS

* Modern stack
* Excellent performance
* Smooth scrolling
* High-quality typography rendering
* Desktop-first thinking (mobile still supported)

Code quality matters.
This site is itself proof of competence.

---

## FINAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

You will deliver:

1. **The website**

   * Fully implemented
   * Production quality
   * Polished interactions

2. **A markdown file**

   * Explains:

     * Brand interpretation
     * Design decisions
     * Copy philosophy
     * Layout rationale
     * Why certain things were intentionally excluded
   * Focus on *what* and *why*, not how

No other deliverables.
No decks.
No moodboards.

---

## FINAL RULE

If a choice feels safe, remove it.
If something explains too much, delete it.
If it looks like something everyone else would ship, start over.

Zorro should feel inevitable, not persuasive.
