# Worklog

## Current Goals
- Initialize project constraints and workflow.
- Define internal brand model (Mandatory Thinking Work).
- Establish "Zorro" identity.

## Active Todos
- [x] Create `references/WORKLOG.md` (Done)
- [x] Define Brand Interpretation (Done)
- [ ] Perform Reference Calibration (Mental check of high-end consultancy vibes)

## Brand Interpretation (Mandatory Thinking Work)
**Adjectives:**
1.  **Inevitable** (Not "possible", but "going to happen")
2.  **Surgical** (Precise, removing the unnecessary)
3.  **Monolithic** (Solid, unshakeable, one piece)
4.  **Accelerant** (Makes things burn faster)
5.  **Sovereign** (Rules itself, doesn't ask for permission)
6.  **Silent** (Doesn't shout, just is)

**Anti-Adjectives:**
1.  **Friendly** (We are not your buddy)
2.  **Explanatory** (We don't teach, we do)
3.  **Hopeful** (Hope is for those who can't execute)
4.  **Playful** (This is serious business)
5.  **Democratic** (We are not for everyone)
6.  **Safe** (Safety is slow)
7.  **Cluttered** (Noise is the enemy)

**Description:**
Zorro is the silent engine that turns intent into reality. It is not a consultancy you hire to "help" you; it is a capability you acquire to bypass the friction of mediocrity. We exist for the founders who know that speed is a structural advantage, not a result of working harder. We do not explain the process; we deliver the outcome. Zorro is the difference between "trying" and "shipping."

## Reasoning
- **Setup**: Establishing this worklog to track decisions and ensure alignment with `DESIGN.md`.
- **Brand Interpretation**: The "Zorro" brand must feel like a secret weapon. It shouldn't try to sell itself; it should imply that if you don't use it, you're already behind. The "Anti-Adjectives" are crucial to avoid the "friendly SaaS" trap.
- **Visual Implications**:
    - Dark, deep blacks (not just dark grey).
    - Sharp typography (Inter or similar, tight tracking).
    - Minimal motion (only what is necessary).
    - No illustrations (unless abstract/geometric).

## Open Questions
- None at this stage.
