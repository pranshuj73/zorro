# Worklog

## Current Goals
- Initialize project constraints and workflow.
- Define internal brand model (Mandatory Thinking Work).
- Establish "Zorro" identity.
- Complete the website (CTA & Footer).
- Expand content depth (Advantage & Services).
- Redesign CTA with embedded form.
- Refine Hero (Copy + Red Line) & Add Mission Section.

## Active Todos
- [x] Create `references/WORKLOG.md` (Done)
- [x] Define Brand Interpretation (Done)
- [x] Perform Reference Calibration (Done)

## Brand Interpretation (Mandatory Thinking Work)
**Adjectives:**
1.  **Inevitable** (Not "possible", but "going to happen")
2.  **Surgical** (Precise, removing the unnecessary)
3.  **Monolithic** (Solid, unshakeable, one piece)
4.  **Accelerant** (Makes things burn faster)
5.  **Sovereign** (Rules itself, doesn't ask for permission)
6.  **Silent** (Doesn't shout, just is)

**Anti-Adjectives:**
1.  **Friendly** (We are not your buddy)
2.  **Explanatory** (We don't teach, we do)
3.  **Hopeful** (Hope is for those who can't execute)
4.  **Playful** (This is serious business)
5.  **Democratic** (We are not for everyone)
6.  **Safe** (Safety is slow)
7.  **Cluttered** (Noise is the enemy)

**Description:**
Zorro is the silent engine that turns intent into reality. It is not a consultancy you hire to "help" you; it is a capability you acquire to bypass the friction of mediocrity. We exist for the founders who know that speed is a structural advantage, not a result of working harder. We do not explain the process; we deliver the outcome. Zorro is the difference between "trying" and "shipping."

## Reference Calibration (Principles Extracted)
**Mental References:** *Linear (early days), Vercel (enterprise pages), Keller (NYC design studio), Pentagram.*

**Principles to Apply:**
1.  **Radical Negative Space:** Don't fill the screen. Let the text breathe. Space = Luxury.
2.  **Type as Image:** Typography isn't just for reading; it's the primary visual element. Large, tight tracking for headlines; readable, generous leading for body.
3.  **The "Fold" is Dead:** Don't cram everything above the fold. Encourage scrolling through curiosity, not density.
4.  **Micro-interactions:** Buttons shouldn't just change color; they should feel magnetic or mechanical.
5.  **Grid Discipline:** Everything must align. If it breaks the grid, it must be intentional and obvious.

## Reasoning
- **Setup**: Establishing this worklog to track decisions and ensure alignment with `DESIGN.md`.
- **Brand Interpretation**: The "Zorro" brand must feel like a secret weapon. It shouldn't try to sell itself; it should imply that if you don't use it, you're already behind. The "Anti-Adjectives" are crucial to avoid the "friendly SaaS" trap.
- **Visual Implications**:
    - Dark, deep blacks (not just dark grey).
    - Sharp typography (Inter or similar, tight tracking).
    - Minimal motion (only what is necessary).
    - No illustrations (unless abstract/geometric).
- **Calibration**: We will avoid the "SaaS gradient" look. We will lean into stark contrast. Black is `#000000` or `#030303`, not `#1a1a1a`.

## Open Questions
- None at this stage.
